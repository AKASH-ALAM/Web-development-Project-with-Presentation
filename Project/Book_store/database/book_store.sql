(2, 'Elephant Kingdom : Sculptures from Indian Architecture ', '1', 'Elephants occupy a special place in the life and art of India. Since ancient times, they have been treasured and pampered as the ultimate beasts of burden, venerated as the vehicles of gods and kings and even worshipped in their own right. Their legendary attributes of strength, intelligence, nobility and longevity are eulogized in myth, epic and popular literature. In the figural and decorative arts, elephants provide an enduring fascination. Elephant Kingdom traces the myriad stories and symbolisms behind India''s much-loved animal, through its depictions in architectural sculpture. At the heart of the study is a collection of over 60 colour photographs from a diversity of antique settings-many of them in remote parts of the subcontinent. At centuries-old temples, monasteries, forts and palaces, elephants flank ceremonial entrances, enrich columns and capitals, form balustrades to stairways or stand as enigmatic sentinels of vast courtyards. Some are legendary characters in tales of dreams and salvation; others enact scenes from a faithfully observed natural history. Some transport kings and heroes into battle and the hunt; others are celestial messengers of rain, fertility and good fortune. From monumental freestanding sculptures to finely-worked narrative friezes, the warmth and energy of these depictions bear testimony to the achievements of countless anonymous artisans.

(3, 'Close to Events-Works of Bikash Bhattacharjee', '2', 'Launching his creative career in the late ?50s, Bikash Bhattacharjee stood out among his contemporaries by making hard-edged chiseled realism the core appeal of his canvases when realism or naturalism of every shade was considered a retrograde trend. Bikash?s strengths were his exceptional technical mastery and his power to charge the tangible appearance of the surface with the reality of the depth beneath. He was admired not merely for the near-illusionist evocation of realistic details, but for the obvious or subtle distortions in his imagery as a key to their complex multi-layered meanings. His realistic idiom is fascinatingly robust and compulsive, laced with rich irony, strong-veined allegory and lush visual metaphors. His portrait-based images enact the artist?s own experience of our time with all its dark social and moral tones and textures. Close to Events: Works of Bikash Bhattacharjee deals with Bikash?s early life in an old North Calcutta locality, the urban social ambience that shaped his creative personality and explores why he chose to remain ?close to events? and free from the dominant trends in post-Independence Indian art. It also analyses the technical and stylistic development of art with detailed exposition of some of the themes and subjects in the major series of his paintings.

(4, 'A Social History of Indian Architecture ', '1', 'Studies in Indian architecture have been confined to those exploring the building techniques of palaces, temples, and tombs. Little attention has traditionally been paid by scholars to the patterns and influences involved in the making of domestic residences, market places, inns, community halls, courts, and other ''lesser'' buildings. The result is the emergence of a very partial picture of what constitutes architecture in India. This volume se eks to overcome this inadequacy by examining the geographical, historical, and functional aspects of architecture in India. Looking beyond the point of view of dynasties, periods or religions, the book traces the various social and historical developments in the field. Following a multi-disciplinary approach that emphasizes sociological aspects, the volume examines in detail, settlement patterns, the architecture of individual houses and chaityas, as also structural materials used for their construction, in addition to those of palaces, funerary monuments, temples, mosques, and monasteries. While examining the planning and design orientation of peoples and architectural techniques across India, the volume pays special attention to that of western India especially Gujarat and Rajasthan. The author also addresses rural and urban patterns of setlement and the linkages between the two. He explains regional and period-specific phenomena, while also quoting from ancient accounts of towns. These vary from the typical urban and rural houses to the Muslim aristocratic residences and Rajput palaces. Based on extensive fieldwork, the author also documents family histories, lifestyles and usage of space to provide a comprehensive social history of Indian architecture. Complemented by over eighty figures including photographs, plans, and detailed diagrams, this book will interest scholars of architecture, history, sociology, and the informed lay reader', 'V.S.

(48, 'Bill and Dave: How Hewlett and Packard Built the World`s Gre', '12', 'This is not a history of the Hewlett-Packard Company, or a book of business theory, or a definitive biography of William Hewlett and David Packard. I have chosen to write this book this way because of the desperate need the business world has right now for an archetype of enlightened management, enduring quality, and perpetual innovation. It is not enough to simply tell the story of Hewlett, Packard and their company. What are needed are the why? and the how?? The most momentous first meeting in modern business history took place in the unlikely setting of a bench beside a football field, between two Stanford University students in pads and helmets. A few years later, in 1938, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard were working in a small garage in Palo Alto, California, building their first product, an audio oscillator. It was the start not only of a legendary company but also of an entire way of life in Silicon Valley?and, ultimately, of our modern digital age. Acclaimed journalist Michael S. Malone is the first to get the full story, based on unlimited and exclusive access to corporate and private archives, along with hundreds of employee interviews. He draws on new material to show how some of the most influential products of our time were invented and how a culture of innovation led HP to unparalleled success for decades. Malone also shows what was really behind the groundbreaking management philosophy??the HP way??that put people ahead of products or profits. Bill and Dave, at its heart, is a character study of two amazing men who revealed their character in how they structured their business, in the men and women they hired, and, most of all, in the power they entrusted to even the lowliest HP employee. Their story is something of a miracle?one from which we can never stop learning.', 'Michael S. Malone ', '2005', '0143102397', 345, 500, 'upload_image/MANAGEMENT2.jpg', 'upload_ebook/mgmt1.pptx'),

In recent years, the dramatic rise in the popularity of relational databases and multiuser databases has fueled a healthy demand for application devel?opers and others who can write SQL code efficiently and correctly. If you?re new to databases or need a SQL refresher, Learning SQL on SQL Server 2005 is an ideal step-by-step introduction to this database query tool, with everything you need for programming SQL using Microsoft?s SQL Server 2005?one of the most powerful and popular database engines used today. Plenty of books explain database theory. This guide lets you apply the theory as you learn SQL. You don?t need prior database knowledge, or even prior computer knowledge. Based on a popular university-level course designed by authors Sikha Saha Bagui and Richard Walsh Earp, Learning SQL on SQL Server 2005 starts with very simple SQL concepts, and slowly builds into more complex query development. Every topic, concept, and idea comes with examples of code and output, along with exercises to help you gain proficiency in SQL and SQL Server 2005. With this book, you?ll learn: * Beginning SQL commands, such as how and where to type an SQL query, and how to create, populate, alter, and delete tables * How to customize SQL Server 2005?s settings and about SQL Server 2005?s functions * About joins, a common database mechanism for combining tables * Query development, the use of views and other derived structures, and simple set operations * Subqueries, aggregate functions, and correlated subqueries, as well as indexes and constraints that can be added to tables in SQL Server 2005 Whether you?re a self-learner who has access to the new Microsoft database, working on SQL Server with access at your company, or a computer science student or MIS student, Learning SQL on SQL Server 2005 will get you up to speed on SQL in no time.\r\n\r\n', 'Sikha Saha Bagui, Richard Walsh Earp ', '2005', '9788184040', 360, 350, 'upload_image/comp10.jpg', 'upload_ebook/sql1.docx');
