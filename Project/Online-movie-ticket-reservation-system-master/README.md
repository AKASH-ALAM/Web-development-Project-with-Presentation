# Online-movie-ticket-reservation-system

This project was developed as a 3nd year group coursework of Introduction to Software Engineering module in our institute and I have worked as the Project Manager and as a Developer also. 
This website was developed for Savoy Cinema to book movie tickets online without any user dissatisfaction. 
We have used bootstrap to develop the front-end and core PHP to develop the back end, and google API's to include location facilities. 
We have try to design this website according to SDLC life cycle and UX Design concepts.
